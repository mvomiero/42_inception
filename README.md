## Nginx

#### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile sets up a container with Nginx, installs OpenSSL to generate a self-signed SSL certificate, copies a custom Nginx configuration file, and exposes port 443 for HTTPS traffic. The Nginx server will be started in the foreground to serve the content over HTTPS on port 443. The self-signed certificate is not suitable for production use, and it's recommended to use a valid SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority for secure and encrypted communication in production environments, but it's fine just for testing purpose.

#### nginx.conf

The nginx.conf file configures an Nginx server to handle HTTPS traffic on port 443 with SSL/TLS encryption. It specifies a domain name (mvomiero.42.fr) and points to SSL certificate and key files. The server is set to serve static files from the /var/www/html directory and process PHP files via a FastCGI server listening at wordpress:9000. It also specifies the default index files to try and defines some FastCGI parameters for PHP handling.
